\section{Simulation Strategy}

A two-prong strategy is followed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop in-house a smaller simulation with capabilities focused towards specific projects. Over time, this simulation can grow organically to serve multiple projects, but in all probability, it will never be an all encompassing simulation tool.  Such  simulation can be freely distributed within the organisation at low/no cost.
    \item Buy a powerful \ac{COTS} system for the more demanding and specialist project needs.  License and  cost restrictions, together with steep learning curve entry barriers,  will limit the wide-scale use of such a tool.  However, some advanced requirements such as large and complex scenarios or \ac{SILS} or \ac{HILS} integration may force the use of such a system.
\end{enumerate}

This document covers the requirements and needs analysis of the second option: a powerful \ac{COTS} simulation tool.
For the purpose of this specification the simulation environment will be called \scesys, irrespective of its commercial product name.
